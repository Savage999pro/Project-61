        <h3>Fishing is one of the greatest hobbies practiced religiously since ancient times. Some call it a sport while others consider it the art of life. Though this began as a means of survival for many, it has now turned into the most favorite activity to do to kill your festering boredom. Fishing is good for the environment, it uses selective fishing methods, adapting to the marine environment and thus avoiding accidental catches. Minimizes energy, chemical and waste production in all your operations. It maintains biodiversity. Ensures true traceability from the capture point to the market. People fish because it teaches us about nature, even while showing us how much we don't know. And fishing becomes the foundation for our fondest memories. In Why We Fish, Robert Montgomery examines the reasons we keep going back to the water and how fishing enriches us, both individually and as a society. Humorous and fascinating stories by ten experienced fishermen (and women) answer that question. We hook fish; they hook us. It’s that simple. Yet, the subject is deeper than it appears. Nationally recognized fishing writer Robert U. Montgomery began pondering this about 20 years ago, when he realized how fishing helped him survive the death of his best friends. Robert discovered that we fish to remember, and we fish to forget. We fish when we’re happy, and when we’re sad. We fish to bond with friends and family, or to be alone. Whatever our motivation, no matter where we are on the success spectrum, fishing makes our lives better in ways we never could have imagined. It slows us down. It sets us free. It teaches us about nature, even while showing us how much we don’t know. And fishing becomes the foundation for our fondest memories. In Why We Fish, Robert Montgomery examines the reasons we keep going back to the water and how fishing enriches us, both individually and as a society. Contributed by ten passionate anglers, the essays on these pages celebrate the tangible and intangible blessings we derive from one of man’s oldest pastimes. What is life all about? Go fishing and find out. But first, enjoy the wonderful essays in Why We Fish. .As you probably already know, fishing can be an expensive hobby. Basic needs for fishing include rods, reels, boats, motors, trolling motors, life preservers, etc, etc. Even a modest fishing enthusiast can spend $2500 or more on these basic start-up materials.</h3>
